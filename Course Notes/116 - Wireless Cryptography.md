## Securing a wireless network
- An organization's wireless network can contain confidential information
	- Not everyone is allowed access
- Authenticate the users before granting access
	- Who gets access to the wireless network?
		- Username
		- Password
		- Multi-factor Authentication
- Ensure that all communication is confidential
	- Encrypt the wireless data
- Verify the integrity of all communication
	- The received data should be identical to the original sent data
	- A message integrity check (MIC)
## Wireless encryption
- All wireless computers are radio transmitters and receivers
	- Anyone can listen in
- Solution:  Encrypt the data
	- Everyone has an encryption key
- Only people with the right key can transmit and listen
	- WPA2 and WPA3
## WPA2 and CCMP
- Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2)
	- WPA2 certification began in 2004
- CCMP Block Cipher Mode
	- Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol
		- Or:  Counter/CBC-MAC Protocol
- CCMP Security Services
	- Data confidentiality with AES
	- Message Integrity Check (MIC) with CBC-MAC
## WPA3 and GCMP
- Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3)
	- Introduced in 2018
- GCMP Block Cipher Mode
	- Galois/Counter Mode Protocol
	- A stronger encryption than WPA2
- GCMP Security Services
	- Data confidentiality with AeS
	- Message Integrity Check (MIC) with Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC)
## The WPA2 PSK problem
- WPA2 has a PSK (Pre Shared Key) brute-force problem
	- Listen to the four-way handshake
		- Some methods can derive the PSK hash without the handshake
	- Capture the hash
- With the hash
	- Attackers can brute force the pre-shared key (PSK)
- This has become easier as technology improves
	- A weak PSK is easier to brute force
	- GPU processing speeds
	- Cloud-based password cracking
- Once you have the PSK, you have everyone's wireless key
	- There's no forward secrecy
## SAE
- WPA3 changes the PSK Authentication Process
	- Includes mutual authentication
	- Creates a shared session key without sending that key across the network
		- Nor more four-way handshakes
		- No Hashes
		- No brute force attacks
	- Adds perfect forward secrecy
- Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)
	- A Diffie-Hellman derived key exchange with an authentication component
	- Everyone uses a different session key
		- Even with the same PSK
	- An IEEE Standard
		- The Dragonfly Handshake
