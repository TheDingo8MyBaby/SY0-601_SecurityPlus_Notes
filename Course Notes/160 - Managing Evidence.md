## Integrity
- Hashing
	- Cryptographic integrity verification
	- A digital "Fingerprint"
- Checksums
	- Protects against accidental changes during transmission
	- A relatively simple integrity check
	- Not designed to replace a hash
- Provenance
	- Documentation of authenticity
	- a chain of custody for data handling
	- Blockchain technology
## Preservation
- Handling evidence
	- Isolate and protect the data
	- Analyze the data later without any alterations
- Manage the collection process
	- Work from copies
	- Manage the data collection from mobile devices
- Live collection has become an important skill
	- Data may be encrypted or difficult to collect after powering down
- Follow best practices to ensure admissibility of data in court
	- What happens now affects the future
## E-discovery
- Electronic discovery
	- Collect
	- Prepare
	- Review
	- Interpret
	- Produce electronic documents
- E-discovery gathers data required by the legal process
	- Does not generally involve analysis
	- There's no consideration of intent
- Works together with digital forensics
	- The e-discovery process obtains a storage drive
	- Data on the drive is smaller than expected
	- Forensics experts determine that data was deleted and attempt to recover the data
## Data recovery
- Extract missing data without affecting the integrity of the data
	- Requires training and expertise
- The recovery process can vary
	- Deleted files
	- Hidden data
	- Hardware or software corruption
	- Storage device is physically damaged
## Non-repudiation
- Proof of data integrity and the origin of the data
	- The data is unchanged and really did come from the sender
	- Hashing the data
- Authentication that is genuine with high confidence
	- The only person who could have sent the data is the sender
- Message Authentication Code (MAC)
	- The two parties can verify non-repudiation
- Digital Signature
	- The non-repudiation can be publicly verified
## Strategic intelligence / counterintelligence
- Strategic intelligence
	- A focus on key threat activity for a domain
		- Business sectors
		- Geographical regions
		- Countries
	- Gather information from;
		- Internal threat reports
		- Third-party data sources
		- Other data inputs
	- Determine the threat landscape based on the trends
- Strategic counterintelligence (CI)
	- Prevent hostile intelligence operations
	- Discover and disrupt foreign intelligence threats
	- Gather threat information on foreign intelligence operations
