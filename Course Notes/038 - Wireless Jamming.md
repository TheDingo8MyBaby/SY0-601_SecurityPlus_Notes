## Radio frequency (RF) jamming
- Denial of Service
	- Prevent wireless communication
- Transmit interfering wireless signals
	- Decrease the signal-to-noise ration at the receiving device
	- The receiving device can't hear the good signal
- Sometimes it's not intentional
	- Interference, not jamming
		- Microwave oven, fluorescent lights
- Jamming is intentional
	- Someone wants your network to not work

## Wireless jamming
- Many different types
	- Constant, random bits / Constant, legitimate frames
	- Data sent at random times
		- random data and legitimate frames
	- Reactive Jamming
		- only when someone else tries to communicate
			- Targeting a specific device
- Needs to be somewhere close
	- Difficult to be effective from a distance
- Time to go fox hunting
	- You'll need the right equipment to hunt down the jam
		- Directional antenna, attenuator
