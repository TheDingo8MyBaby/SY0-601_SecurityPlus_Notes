- The only constant is change
	- Operating systems
	- Patches
	- Application updates
	- Network modifications
	- net application instances
	- Etc...
- Identify and document hardware and software settings
	- Manage the security when changes occur
- Rebuild those systems if a disaster occurs
	- Documentation and processes will be critical

## Diagrams
- Network diagrams
	- Document the physical wire and device
- Physical data center layout
	- Can include physical rack locations
- Device diagrams
	- Individual cabling

## Baseline configuration
- The security of an application environment should be well defines
	- All application instances must follow this baseline
		- Firewall Settings
		- Patch levels
		- OS File versions
	- May require constant updates
- Integrity measurements check for the secure baseline
	- These should be performed often
	- Check against well-documented baselines
	- Failure requires an immediate correction

## Standard Naming Conventions
- Create a standard
	- Needs to be easily understood by everyone
- Devices
	- Asset Tag Names and Numbers
	- Computer Names
		- Location or Region
	- Serial Numbers
- Networks
	- Port labeling
- Domain configurations
	- User account names
	- Standard email addresses

## IP Schema
- And IP address plan or model
	- Consistent addressing for network devices
	- Helps avoid duplicate IP adressing
- Locations
	- Number of subnets
	- Hosts per subnet
- IP Ranges
	- Different sites have a different subnet
		- 10.1.x.x/24
		- 10.2.x.x/24
		- 10.3.x.x/24
- Reserved addresses
	- Users
	- Printers
	- Routers/Default Gateways
