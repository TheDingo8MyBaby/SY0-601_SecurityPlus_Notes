- Force a service to fail
	- Overload the service
- Take advantage of a design failure or vulnerability
	- Keep your systems patched
- Cause a system to be unvailable
	- Competitive advantage
- Create a smokescreen for some other exploit
	- Precursor to a DNS spoofing attack
- Doesn't have to be complicated
	- Turn off Power

## A "friendly" DoS
- Unintentional DoSing
	- It's not always a ne'er-do-well
- Network DoS
	- Layer 2 loop without STP
- Bandwidth DoS
	- Downloading multi-gigabyte Linux Distributions over a DSL line
- The water line breaks
	- Get a good Shop Vacuum

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDos)
- Launch an army of computers to being down a service
	- Use all the bandwidth or resources - traffic spike
- The is why the attackers have botnets
	- Thousands or millions of computers at your command
	- At its peak, Zeus botnet infected over 3.6 millions PCs
	- Coordinated attack
- Asymmetric threat
	- The attacker may have fewer resources than the victim

## DDoS amplification
- Turn your small attack into a big attack
	- Often reflected off another device or service
- An increasingly common network DDoS technique
	- Turn internet services against the victim
- Uses protocols with little (if any), authentication or checks
	- NTP, DNS, ICMP
	- A common example of protocol abuse

## Turning up the volume

- Make the application break or work harder
	- Increase downtime and costs
- Fill the disk space
	- A 42 kilobyte .zip compressed file
	- Uncompresses to 4.5 petabytes (4,500 terabytes)
	- Anti-virus will identify these
- Overuse a measured cloud resource
	- More CPU/memory/network is more money
- Increase the cloud server response time
	- Victim deploys a new application instance
	- Repeat

## Operational Technology (OT) DoS
- The hardware and software for industrial equipment
	- Electric grids, traffic control, manufacturing plants, etc.
- This is more than a web server failing
	- The power grid drops offline
	- All traffic lights are green
	- Manufacturing plants shuts down
- Requires a different approach
	- A much more critical security posture
