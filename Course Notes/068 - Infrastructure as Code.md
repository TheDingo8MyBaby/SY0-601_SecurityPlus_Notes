- Describe an infrastructure
	- Define servers, network, and applications as code
- Modify the infrastructure and create versions
	- The same way you version application code
- Use the description (code) to build other application instances
	- Built it the same way every time, based on the code
- An important concept for cloud computing
	- Build a perfect version every time

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020240416194149.png)## SDN (Software Defined Networking)
- Networking devices have two functional planes of operation
	- Control plane
	- Data plane
- Directly programmable
	- Configuration is different than forwarding
- Agile
	- Changes can be made dynamically
- Centrally managed
	- Global view
		- Single pane of glass
- Programmatically configured
	- No human intervention
- Open standards / Vendor Neutral
	- A standard interface to the network

## SDN Security

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020240416194500.png)## SDV (Software Defined Visibility)
- You must see the traffic to secure the data
	- React and respond
- Dynamic deployments include security and network visibility devices
	- Next-generation firewalls
	- Web application firewalls
	- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Data is encapsulated and encrypted
	- CXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) and SSL/TLS
- New technologies change what you can see
	- Infrastructure as code
		- Microservices
- Security devices monitor application traffic
	- SDV provides visibility to traffic flows
- Visiitbility expands as the application instances expand
	- Real-time metrics across all traffic flows
- Application flows can be controlled via API
	- Identify and react to threats
