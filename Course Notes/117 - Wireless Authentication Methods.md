- Gain access to a wireless network
	- Mobile users
	- Temporary users
- Credentials
	- Shared password / Pre-shared Key (PSK)
	- Centralized authentication (802.1X)
- Configuration
	- Part of the wireless network connection
	- Prompted during the connection process
## Wireless security modes
- Configure the authentication on your wireless access point / wireless router
- Open System
	- No password is required
- WPA3-Personal / WPA3-PSK
	- WPA3 with a pre-shared key
	- Everyone uses the same key
	- Unique WPA3 session key is derived from the PSK using SAE
		- (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)
- WPA3-Enterprise / WPA3-802.1X
	- Authenticates users individually with an authentication server
		- i.e:)  RADIUS
## Captive portal
- Authentication to a network
	- Common on wireless networks
- Username/Password
	- And additional authentication factors
- Once proper authentication is provided
	- The web session continues
		- Until the captive portal removes your access
## Using WPS
- Wi-Fi Protected Setup
	- Originally called Wi-Fi Simple Config
- Allow `"Easy"` setup of a mobile device
	- A passphrase can be complicated to a novice
- Different ways to connect
	- PIN configured on access point must be entered on the mobile device
	- Push a button on the access point
	- Near-Field Communication
		- Bring the mobile device close to the access point
## The WPS hack
- December 2011 - WPS has a design flaw
	- It was built wrong from the beginning
- PIN is an eight-digit number
	- Really seven digits and a checksum
	- Seven Digits
		- 10,000,000 Possible Combinations
- The WPS process validates each half of the PIN
	- First half
		- 4 Digits
	- Second half
		- 3 Digits
	- First Half
		- 10,000 Possibilities
	- Second Half
		- 1,000 Possibilities
- It takes about four hours to go through all of them
	- Most devices never considered a lockout function
	- Brute force lockout features are now the norm
