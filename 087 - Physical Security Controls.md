## Barricades / bollards
- Prevent access
	- There are limits to the prevention
- Channel people through a specific access point
	- And keep out other things
		- Allow People, prevent cards and trucks
- Identify safety concerns
	- And prevent injuries
- Can be used to an extreme
	- Concrete barriers / bollards
	- Moats
## Access control vestibules
- All doors normally unlocked
	- Opening one door causes other to lock
- All doors normally locked
	- Unlocking one door prevents others from being unlocked
- One door open / other locked
	- When one is open, the other cannot be unlocked
- One at a time, controlled groups
	- Managed control through an area
## Alarms
- Circuit-based
	- Circuit is opened or closed
		- Door
		- Window
		- Fence
	- Useful on the perimeter
- Motion detection
	- Radio reflection or passive infrared
	- Useful in areas not often in use
- Duress (Panic Button)
	- Triggered by a person
	- The big red button
## Signs
- Clear and specific instructions
	- Keep people away from restricted areas
	- Consider visitors
- Consider personal safety
	- Fire exits
	- Warning signs
		- Chemicals
		- Construction
	- Medical resources
- Informational
	- In case of emergency, call this number
## Video Surveillance
- CCTV (Closed circuit television)
	- Can replace physical guards
- Camera features are important
	- Motion recognition can alarm and alert when something moves
	- Object detection can identify a license plate or person's face*
- Often many different cameras
	- Networked together and recorded over time
## Industrial camouflage
- Conceal an important facility in plain sight
	- Blends in to the local environment
- Protect a data center
	- No business signs
	- No visual clues
	- Surround it with a water feature
	- Install a guard gate
	- Planters out front are bollards
## Guards and access lists
- Security guard
	- Physical protection at the reception area of a facility
	- Validates identification of existing employees
	- Provides guest access
- ID Badge
	- Picture
	- Name
	- Etc...
	- Must be worn at all times
- Access list
	- Physical list of names
	- Enforced by security guard
- Maintains a visitor log
## Guards
- Two-person integrity/control
	- Minimize exposure to an attack
	- No single person has access to a physical asset
- Robot sentries
	- Monitoring
	- Rounds/Periodic checks
	- An emerging technology
## Biometrics
- Biometric authentication
	- Fingerprint
	- Retina
	- Voiceprint
- Usually stores a mathematical representation of your biometric
	- Your actual fingerprint isn't usually saved
- Difficult to change
	- You can change your password
	- You can't change your fingerprint
- Used in very specific situations
	- Not foolproof
## Door access controls
- Conventional
	- Lock and Key
- Deadbolt
	- Physical bolt
- Electronic
	- Keyless
	- PIN
- Token-based
	- RFID badge
	- Magnetic Swipe Card
	- Key Fob
- Biometric
	- Hands
	- Fingers
	- Retina
- Multi-factor
	- Smart card And PIN
## Cable locks
- Temporary security
	- Connect your hardware to something solid
- Cable works almost anywhere
	- Useful when mobile
- Most devices have a standard connector
	- Reinforced notch
- Not designed for long-term protection
	- Those cables are pretty thin
## USB data blocker
- Don't connect to unknown USB interfaces
	- Even if you need a quick charge
	- Prevent "Juice Jacking"
- Use a USB data blocker
	- Allow the voltage, reject the data
- Use your power adapter
	- Avoid the issue entirely
## Proper lighting
- More light means more security
	- Attackers avoid the light
	- Easier to see when lit
	- Non IR cameras can see better
- Specialized design
	- Consider overall light levels
	- Lighting angles may be important
		- Facial recognition
	- Avoid shadows and glare
## Fencing
- Build a perimeter
	- Usually very obvious
	- May not be what you're looking for
- Transparent or opaque
	- See through the fence (or not)
- Robust
	- Difficult to cut the fence
- Prevent climbing
	- Razor wire
	- Build it high
## Fire suppression
- Electronics require unique responses to fire
	- Water is generally a bad thing
- Detection
	- Smoke detector
	- Flame detector
	- Heat detector
- Suppress with water
	- Where appropriate
- Suppress with chemicals
	- Halon (No long manufactured)
		- Destroys ozone
	- Commonly replaced with:
		- Dupont FM-200
## Sensors
- Motion detection
	- Identify movement in an area
- Noise detection
	- Recognize an increase in sound
- Proximity reader
	- Commonly used with electronic door locks
	- Combined with an access card
- Moisture detection
	- Useful to identify water leaks
- Temperature
	- Monitor changes over time
## Drones
- Quickly cover large areas
	- More than just one building
- More than physical security
	- Site surveys
	- Damage assessments
- On-board sensors
	- Motion detection
	- Thermal sensors
- Video evidence
	- High resolution video capture
## Faraday cage
- Blocks electromagnetic fields
	- Discovered by Michael Faraday in 1836
- A mesh conductive material
	- The cage cancels the electromagnetic field's effect on the interior
		- The windows of a microwave over
- Not a comprehensive solution
	- Not all signal types are blocked
	- Some signal types a not blocked at all
- Can restrict access to mobile networks
	- Some very specific contingencies would need to be in place for emergency calls
## Screened subnet
- Formerly known as a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)
	- An additional layer of security between the internet and you
- Public access to public resources
## Protected distribution
- Protected Distribution System (PDS)
	- A physically secure cabled network
- Protect your cables and fibers
	- All of the data flows through these conduits
- Prevent cable and fiber taps
	- Direct taps and inductive taps
- Prevent cable and fiber cuts
	- A physical denial of Service (DoS)
- Hardened protected distribution system
	- Sealed metal conduit
	- Periodic visual inspection
