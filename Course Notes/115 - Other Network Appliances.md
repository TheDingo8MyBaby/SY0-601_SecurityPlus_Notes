## Jump server
- Access secure network zones
	- Provides an access mechanism to a protected network
- Highly-secured device
	- Hardened and monitored
- SSH / Tunnel / VPN to the jump server
	- RDP
	- SSH
	- Jump from there
- A significant security concern
	- A compromise to the jump server is a significant breach

## Hardware Security Module (HSM)
- Used in large environments
	- Clusters
	- Redundant power
- High-end cryptographic hardware
	- Plug-in card or separate hardware device
- Key backup
	- Secured storage
- Cryptographic accelerators
	- Offload that CPU overhead from other devices
## Sensors and collectors
- Aggregate information from network devices
	- Built-in sensors
	- Separate devices
	- Integrated into:
		- Switches
		- Routers
		- Servers
		- Firewalls
		- Etc...
- Sensors
	- Intrusion prevention systems
	- Firewall logs
	- Authentication logs
	- Web server access logs
	- Database transaction logs
	- Email logs
- Collectors
	- Proprietary consoles
		- IPS
		- Firewall
		- SIEM (Security, Information & Event Management) Consoles
		- Syslog Servers
	- Many SIEMs include a correlation engine to compare diverse sensor data
