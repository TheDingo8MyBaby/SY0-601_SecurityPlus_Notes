## 5G
- Fifth Generation cellular networking
	- Launched worldwide in 2020
- Significant performance improvements
	- At higher frequencies
	- Eventually 10 gigabits per second
	- Slower speeds from 100-900 mbit/s
- Significant IoT impact
	- Bandwidth becomes less of a constraint
	- Larger data transfers
	- Faster monitoring and notification
	- Additional cloud processing
## Subscriber identity module (SIM)
- SIM card
	- A universal integrated circuit card
- Used to provide information to a cellular network provider
	- Phones
	- Tablets
	- Embedded systems
- Contains mobile details
	- IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)
	- Authentication information
	- Contact information
- Important to manage
	- Many embedded systems
	- Many SIM cards
## Narrowband
- Communicate analog signals over a narrow range of frequencies
	- Over a longer distance
	- Conserve the frequency used
- Many IoT devices can communicate over long distances
	- SCADA equipment
	- Sensors in oil fields
## Baseband
- Generally a single cable with a digital signal
	- Can be fiber or copper
- The communication signal uses all of the bandwidth
	- Utilization is either 0% or 100%
- Bidirectional communication
	- But not at the same time using the same wire/fiber
- Ethernet Standard
	- 100BASE-TX
	- 1000BASE-T
	- 10GBASE-T
## Zigbee
- Internet of things networking
	- Open Standard
		- IEEE 802.15.4 PAN
- Alternative to WiFi and Bluetooth
	- Longer distances than Bluetooth
	- Less power consumption than WiFi
- Mesh network of all Zigbee devices in your home
	- Light switch communicates to lightbulbs
	- Tell Amazon Echo to lock the door
- Uses the ISM band
	- Industrial, Scientific, and Medical
	- 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz frequencies in the US
