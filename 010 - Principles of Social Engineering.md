## Effective social engineering
- Constantly changing
	- You never know what they'll use next
- May involve multiple people
	- And multiple organizations
	- There are ties connecting many organizations
- May be in person or electronic
	- Phone calls from aggressive "Customers"
	- Emailed funeral notifications of a friend or associate

## Social engineering priciples
- Authority
	- The social engineer is in charge
	- "I'm calling from the help desk / office of the CEO / Police"
- Intimidation
	- There will be bad things if you don't help
	- "If you don't help me, the payroll checks won't be processed"
- Consensus / Social Proof
	- Convince based on what's normally expected
	- "Your co-worker Jill did this for me last week"
- Scarcity
	- The situation will not be this way for long
	- Must make the change before time expires
- Urgency
	- Works alongside scarcity
	- Act quickly, don't think
- Familiarity / Liking
	- Someone you know, we have common friends
- Trust
	- Someone who is safe
	- "I'm from IT, and I'm here to help"

## How I lost my $50,000 Twitter username
- Naoki Hiroshima - @N
	- https://professormesser.link/twittername
- Attacker calls PayPal and uses social engineering to get the last four digits of the credit card on file
- Attacker calls GoDaddy and tells them he lost the card, so he can't properly validate.  But he has the last four, does that help?
	- GoDaddy let the bad guy guess the first two digits of the card
	- Attacker was allowed to keep guessing until he got it right
	- Social engineering done really, really well

## How to steal a $50,000 Twitter name
- Attacker is now in control of every domain name
	- And there were some good ones
- Attacker extorts a swap
	- Domain control for @N
	- Owner agrees
- Twitter reviewed the case for a month
	- Eventually restored access to @N
