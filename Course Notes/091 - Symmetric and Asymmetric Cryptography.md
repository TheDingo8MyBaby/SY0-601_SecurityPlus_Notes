## Symmetric encryption
- A single, shared key
	- Encrypt with the key
	- Decrypt with the same key
	- If it gets out, you'll need another key
- Secret key algorithm
	- A shared secret
- Doesn't scale very well
	- Can be challenging to distribute
- Very fast to use
	- Less overhead than asymmetric encryption
	- Often combined asymmetric encryption
## Asymmetric encryption
- Public key cryptography
	- Two (or more) mathematically related keys
