- Plan for change
	- Implement automatically
- Automated courses of action
	- Many problems can be predicted
	- Have a set of automated responses
- Continuous monitoring
	- Check for a particular event, and then react
- Configuration validation
	- Cloud-based technologies allow for constant change
	- Automatically validate a configuration before going live
	- Perform ongoing automated checks

## Continuous Integration (CI)
- Code is constantly written
	- And merged into the central repository many times a day
- So many chances for security problems
	- Security should be a concern from the beginning
- Basic set of security checks during development
	- Documented security baselines as the bare minimum
- Large-scale security analysis during the testing phase
	- Significant problems will have already been covered

## Continuous delivery/deployment (CD)
- Continuous delivery
	- Automate the testing process
	- Automate the release process
		- Click a button and deploy the application
- Continuous deployment
	- Even more automation
	- Automatically deploy to production
	- No human integration or manual checks
