- IT security doesn't change because it's a third-party
	- There should be more security, not less
- Always expect the worst
	- Prepare for a breach
- Human error is still the biggest issue
	- Everyone needs to use IT security best practices
- All security is important
	- Physical security and cybersecurity work hand-in-hand

## System integration risk
- Professional installation and maintenance
	- Can include elevated OS access
- Can be on-site
	- With physical or virtual access to data and systems
	- Keylogger installations and USB flash drive data transfers
- Can run software on the internal network
	- Less security on the inside
	- Port Scanners, traffic captures
	- Inject malware and spyware
		- Sometimes inadvertently

## Lack of vendor support
- Security requires diligence
	- The potential for a vulnerability is always there
- Vendors are the only ones who can fix their products
	- Assuming they know about the problem
		- And care about fixing it
- Trane Comfortlink II thermostats
	- Control the temperature from your phone
	- Trane notified of three vulnerabilities in April 2014
	- Two patches:
		- April 2015
		- January 2016

## Supply chain risk
- You can't always control security at a third-party location
	- Always maintain local security controls
- Hardware and software from a vendor can contain malware
	- Verify the security of new systems
- Counterfeit hardware is out there
	- It looks like a Cisco switch
	- Is it malicious?

## Outsourced code development
- Accessing the code base
	- Internal access over a VPN
	- Cloud-based access
- Verify security to other systems
	- The development systems should be isolated
- Test the code security
	- Check for backdoors
	- Validate data protection and encryption

## Data storage
- Consider the type of data
	- Contact information
	- Healthcare details, financial information
- Storage at a third-party may need encryption
	- Limits exposure
	- Adds complexity
- Transferring data
	- The entire data flow needs to be encrypted
