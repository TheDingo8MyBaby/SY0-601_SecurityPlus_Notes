## Edge vs. Access control
- Control at the edge
	- Your Internet link
	- Managed primarily through firewall rules
	- Firewall rules rarely change
- Access Control
	- Control from wherever you are
		- Inside or Outside
	- Access can be based on many rules
		- User
		- Group
		- Location
		- Application
		- Etc...
	- Access can be easily revoked or changed
		- Change your security posture at any time
## Posture assessment
- You can't trust everyone's computer
	- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)
	- Malware infections
		- Missing anti-malware
	- Unauthorized applications
- Before connecting to the network, perform a health check
	- Is it a trusted device?
	- Is it running anti-virus?
		- Which one?
		- Is it updated?
	- Are the corporate applications installed?
	- Is it a mobile device?
		- Is the disk encrypted?
	- The type of device doesn't matter
		- Windows
		- Mac
		- Linux
		- iOS
		- Android
		- Etc...
## Health checks / Posture assessment
- Persistent agents
	- Permanently installed onto a system
	- Periodic updates may be required
- Dissolvable agents
	- No installation is required
	- Runs during the posture assessment
	- Terminates when no longer required
- Agentless NAC
	- Integrated with Active Directory
	- Checks are made during login and logoff
	- Can't be scheduled
## Failing your assessment
- What happens when a posture assessment fails?
	- Too dangerous to allow access
- Quarantine network, notify administrators
	- Just enough network access to fix the issue
- Once resolved, try again
	- May require additional fixes
