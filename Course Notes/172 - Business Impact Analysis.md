## Recovery
- Recovery time objective (RTO)
	- Get up and running quickly
	- Get back to a particular service level
- Recovery point objective (RPO)
	- How much data loss is acceptable?
	- Bring the system back online;
		- How far back does the data go?
- Mean time to repair (MTTR)
	- Time required to fix the issue
- Mean time between failures (MTBF)
	- Predict the time between outages
## Functional recovery plans
- Recover from an outage
	- Step-by-step guide
- Contact information
	- Someone is on-call
	- Keep everyone up to date
- Technical process
	- Reference the knowledge base
	- Follow the internal processes
- Recover and test
	- Confirm normal operation
## Removing single points of failure
- A single event can ruin your day
	- Unless you make some plans
- Network configuration
	- Multiple devices
- Facility / Utilities
	- Backup power
	- Multiple cooling devices
- People / Location
	- A good hurricane can disrupt personnel travel
- There's no practical way to remove all points of failure
	- Money drive redundancy
## Redundancy

## Disaster recovery plan (DRP)
- Detailed plan for resuming operations after a disaster
	- Application
	- Data center
	- Building
	- Campus
	- Region
	- Etc...
- Extensive planning prior to the disaster
	- Backups
	- Off-site data replication
	- Cloud alternatives
	- Remote site
- Many third-party options
	- Physical locations
	- Recovery services
## Impact
- Life (Human)
	- The most important consideration
- Property
	- The risk to buildings and assets
		- Flooding
		- Electrical
		- Etc...
- Safety
	- Some environments are too dangerous to work in
- Finance
	- The resulting financial cost
- Reputation
	- An event can cause status or character problems
## Mission-essential functions
- If a hurricane blew through;
	- What functions would be essential to the organization?
		- There's where you start your analysis
		- These are broad business requirements
- What computing systems are required for these mission-essential business functions?
	- Identify the critical systems
## Site risk assessment
- All locations are a bit different
	- Even those designed to be similar
- Recovery plans should consider unique environments
	- Applications
	- Personnel
	- Equipment
	- Work Environment
