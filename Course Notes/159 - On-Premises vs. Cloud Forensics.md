## Forensics in the cloud
- Adding complexity to the digital forensics process
	- Cloud technologies
- Technical challenges
	- Devices are not totally in your control
	- There may be limited access
	- Associate data with a specific user
- Legal issues
	- Laws are different around the world
	- The rules may not be immediately obvious
## Right-to-audit clauses

	- Everyone agrees to the terms and conditions
	- Ability to verify security before a breach occurs
## Regulatory / jurisdiction
- Cloud computing technology appeared relatively quickly
	- The legal world is scrambling to catch up
- Forensics professionals must know their legal rights
	- Data in a different jurisdiction may be bound by very different regulations
- Data stored in cloud may not be located in the same country
	- Location of the data center may determine how data can be treated
- Location of the data is critical
	- Legal frameworks vary widely between countries
	- Some counties don't allow electronic searches outside of their borders
## Data breach notification laws
- Notification laws
	- If consumer data is breached
		- The consumer must be informed
- Many data breach notification laws
	- Vary widely across counties and localities
