- Need information before the attack
	- Can't rush blindly into battle
- Gathering a digital footprint
	- Learn everything you can
- Understand the security posture
	- Firewalls
	- Security Configurations
- Minimize the attack area
	- Focus on key systems
- Create a network map
	- Identify: 
		- Routers
		- Networks
		- Remote sites

## Passive footprinting
- Learn as much as you can from open sources
	- There's a lot of information out there
		- Remarkably difficult to protect or identify
- Social Media
- Corporate Web-site
- Online forums, Reddit
- Social engineering
- Dumpster diving
- Business organizations

## Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
- Gathering information from many open sources
	- Find information on anyone or anything
	- The name is not related to open-source software
- Data is EVERYWHERE
	- https://osintframework.com/
- Automated gathering
	- Many software tools available

## Wardriving or Warflying
- Combine WiFi monitoring and a GPS
	- Search from your car or plane
	- Search from a drone
- Huge amount of intel in a short period of time
	- And often surprising results
- All of this is free
	- Kismet
	- inSSIDer
	- Wireless Geographic Logging Engine

## Active footprinting
- Trying the doors
	- Maybe one is unlocked
		- Don't open it yet
	- Relatively easy to be seen
- Visible on network traffic and logs
- Ping scans
	- Port scans
- DNS queries
- OS scans
	- OS fingerprinting
