## Exercise
- Test yourselves before an actual event
	- Scheduled update sessions
		- Annual
		- Semi-annual
		- Etc...
- Use well-defined rules of engagement
	- Do not touch the production systems
- Very specific scenario
	- Limited time to run the event
- Evaluate response
	- Document and discuss
## Tabletop exercises
- Performing a full-scale disaster drill can be costly
	- And time consuming
- Many of the logistics can be determined through analysis
	- You don't physically have to go through a disaster or drill
- Get key players together for a tabletop exercise
	- Talk through a simulated disaster
## Walkthrough
- Include responders
	- A step beyond a tabletop exercise
	- Many moving parts
- Test processes and procedures before an event
	- Walk through each step
	- Involve all groups
	- Reference actual response materials
- Identifies actual faults or missing steps
	- The walkthrough applies the concepts from the tabletop exercise
## Simulation
- Test with a simulated event
	- Phishing attack
	- Password requests
	- Data breaches
- Going phishing
	- Create a phishing email attack
	- Send to your actual user community
		- See who bites
- Test internal security
	- Did the phishing get past the filter?
- Test the users
	- Who clicked?
	- Additional training may be required
## Stakeholder management
- Keeping a good ongoing relationship with customers of IT
	- These can be internal or external customers
	- An incident response will require teamwork
	- Without the stakeholder, IT would not exist
- Most of this happens prior to an incident
	- Ongoing communication and meetings
	- Exercises should include the customers

	- Keep the organization up and running
- Disaster are many and varied
	- Natural disasters
	- Technology or system failures
	- Human-created disasters
- A comprehensive plan
	- Recovery location
	- Data recovery method
	- Application restoration
	- IT team and employee availability
## Continuity of operations planning (COOP)
- Not everything goes according to plan
	- Disasters can cause a disruption to the norm
- We rely on our computer systems
	- Technology is pervasive
- There needs to be an alternative
	- Manual transactions
	- Paper receipts
	- Phone calls for transaction approvals
- These must be documented and tested before a problem occurs
## Incident response team
- Receives, review, and responds

	- DDoS
- May or may not be part of the organizational structure
	- Pulled together on an as-needed basis
- Focuses on incident handling
	- Incident response
	- Incident analysis
	- Incident reporting
## Retention policies
- Backup your data
	- How much and where?
		- Copies
		- Versions of copies
		- Lifecycle of data
		- Purging old data
- Regulatory compliance
	- A certain amount of data backup may be required
- Operational needs
	- Accidental deletion
	- Disaster recovery
- Differentiate by type and application
