## Exploiting an application
- Attackers often exploit application vulnerabilities
	- They find the unlocked door, and open it
- Once your exploit one binary, you can exploit them all
	- The application works the same on all systems
		- A Windows 10 exploit affects all Windows 10 users
- What if all of the computers were running different software?
	- Unique binaries
	- Functionally identical

## Software diversity
- Alternative compiler paths would result in a different binary each time
	- Each compiled application would be a little bit different
	- But functionally the same
- An attack against different binaries would only be successful on a fraction of the users
	- An attacker wouldn't know what exploit to use
	- Make the game much harder to win
