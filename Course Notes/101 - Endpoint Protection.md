## The endpoint
- The user's access
	- Applications and data
- Stop the attackers
	- Inbound attacks
	- Outbound attacks
- Many different platforms
	- Mobile
	- Desktop
	- Etc...
- Protection is multi-faceted
	- Defense in depth
## Anti-virus and anti-malware
- Anti-virus is the popular term
	- Refers specifically to a type of malware
		- Trojans
		- Worms
		- Macro Viruses
- Malware refers to the broad malicious software category
	- Anti-malware stops:
		- Spyware
		- Ransomware
		- Fileless malware
		- Etc...
- The terms are effectively the same these days
	- The names are more of a marketing tool
	- Anti-virus software is also anti-malware software now
	- Make sure your system is using a comprehensive solution
## Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
- A different method of threat protection
	- Scale to meet the increasing number of threats
- Detect a threat
	- Signatures aren't the only detection tool
		- Behavioral analysis
		- Machine learning
		- Process monitoring
	- Lightweight agent on the endpoint
- Investigate the threat
	- Root cause analysis
- Respond to the threat
	- Isolate the system
	- Quarantine the threat
	- Rollback to a previous config
		- API Driven
		- No user or technician intervention required 
## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Where's your data?
	- Social Security Numbers
	- Credit Card Numbers
	- Medical Records
- Stop the data before the attacker gets it
	- Data "Leakage"
- So many sources, so many destinations
	- Often requires multiple solutions
	- Endpoint clients
	- Cloud-based systems
		- Email
		- Cloud Storage
		- Collaboration tools
## Next-generation firewall (NGFW)
- The OSI Application Layer
	- All data in every packet
- Can be called different names
	- Application layer gateway
	- Stateful multilayer inspection
	- Deep packet inspection
- Broad security controls
	- Allow or disallow application features
	- Identify attacks and malware
	- Examine encrypted data
	- Prevent access to URLs or URL categories
## Host-based firewall
- Software-based firewall
	- Personal firewall
	- Runs on every endpoint
- Allows or disallow incoming or outgoing application traffic
	- Control by application process
	- View all data
- Identify and block unknown processes
	- Stop malware before it can start
- Manage centrally
## Finding intrusions
- Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)
	- Uses log files to identify intrusions
	- Can reconfigure firewalls to block
- Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)
	- Recognize and block known attacks
		- Secure OS and application configs
		- Validate incoming Service requests
	- Often built into endpoint protection software
- HIPS identification
			- Signatures
			- Heuristics
			- Behavioral
		- Buffer overflows
		- Registry Updates
		- Writing files to the Windows Folder
	- Access to non-encrypted data
