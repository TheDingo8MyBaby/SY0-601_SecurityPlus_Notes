## Attacks can happen anywhere
- Two categories for IT Security
	- The on-premises data is more secure!
	- The cloud-based data is more secure!
- Cloud-based security is centralized and costs less
	- No dedicated hardware, no data center to secure
	- A third-party handles everything
- On-premises puts the security burden on the client
	- Data center security and infrastructure costs
- Attackers want your data
	- They don't care where it is
