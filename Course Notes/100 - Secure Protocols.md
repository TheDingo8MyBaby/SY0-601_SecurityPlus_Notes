## Voice and Video
- SRTP
	- Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol / Secure RTP
- Ads security features to RTP
	- Keeps conversations private
- Encryption
	- Uses AES to encrypt the voice/video flow
- Authentication, Integrity, and Replay protection
	- HMAC-SHA1
		- Hash-Based message authentication code using SHA1
## Time synchronization
- Classic NTP has no security features
	- Exploited as amplifiers in DDoS attacks
	- NTP has been around prior to 1985
- NTPsec
	- Secure network time protocol
	- Began development in June of 2015
- Cleaned up the code base
	- Fixed a number of vulnerabilities
## Email
- S/MIME
	- Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
	- Public key encryption and digital signing of mail content
	- Requires a PKI or similar organization of keys
- Secure POP and Secure IMAP
	- Use a STARTTLS Extension to encrypt POP3 with SSL or use IMAP with SSL
- SSL/TLS
	- If the mails is browser based
		- Always encrypt with SSL
## Web
- SSL/TLS
	- Secure Sockets Layer
	- Transport Layer Security
- HTTPS
	- HTTP over TLS
		- HTTP over SSL
	- HTTP Secure
- Uses public key encryption
	- Private key on the server
	- Symmetric session key is transferred using asymmetric encryption
	- Security and speed
## IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)
- Security for OSI Layer 3
	- Authentication and encryption for every packet
- Confidentiality and integrity/anti-replay
	- Encryption and packet signing
- Very standardized
	- Common to use multi-vendor implementations
- Two core IPsec protocols
	- Authentication Header (AH)
	- Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP)
## File transfer
- FTPS
	- FTP over SSL (FTP-SSL)
	- File Transfer Protocol Secure
		- This is NOT SFTP
- SFTP
	- SSH File Transfer Protocol
	- Provides file system functionality
		- Resuming interrupted transfers
		- Directory listings
		- Remote file removal
## LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
- Protocol for reading and writing directories over an IP network
	- An organized set of records
		- Like a phone directory
- X.500 Specification was written by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)
	- They know directories!
- DAP ran on the OSI protocol stack
	- LDAP is lightweight, and uses TCP/IP
