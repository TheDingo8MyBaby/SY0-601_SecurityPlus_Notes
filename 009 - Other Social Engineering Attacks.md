## Tailgating
- Use an authorized person to gain unauthorized access to a building
	- Not an accident
- Johnny Long / No Tech Hacking
	- Blend in with clothing
	- 3rd-party with a legitimate reason
	- Temporarily take up smoking
	- I still prefer bringing doughnuts (Have food in hand)
- Once inside, there's little to stop you
	- Most security stops at the border

## Watching for tailgating
- Policy for visitors
	- You should be able to identify anyone
- One scan, one person
	- A matter of policy or mechanically required
- Access Control Vestibule / Airlock
	- You don't have a choice (Train Turnstyle)
- Don't be afraid to ask
	- Who are you and why are you here?

## Invoice scams
- Starts with a bit of spear phishing
	- Attacker knows who pays the bills
- Attacker sends a fake invoice
	- Domain renewal, toner, etc.
	- From: address is a spoofed version of the CEO
- Accounting pays the invoice
	- It was from the CEO, after all
- Might also include a link to pay
	- Now the attacker has payment details

## Credential harvesting
- Also called password harvesting
	- Attackers collect login credentials
- There are a lot of stored credentials on your computer
	- The attacker would like those
	- Chrome, Firefox, Outlook, Etc.
- User receives an email with a malicious Microsoft Word Doc
	- Opening the document runs a macro
	- The macro downloads credential-harvesting malware
- User has no idea
	- Everything happens in the background.
