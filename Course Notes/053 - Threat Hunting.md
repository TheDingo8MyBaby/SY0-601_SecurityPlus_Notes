- The constant game of cat and mouse
	- Find the attacker before they find you
- Strategies are constantly changing
	- Firewalls get stronger, so phishing gets better
- Intelligence data is reactive
	- You can't see the attack until it happens
- Speed up the reaction time
	- Use technology to fight

## Intelligence fusion
- An overwhelming amount of security data
	- Too much data to properly detect, analyze, and react
- Many data types
	- Dramatically different in type and scope
- Separate teams
	- Security operations, security intelligence, threat response
- Fuse the security data together with big data analytics
	- Analyze massive and diverse datasets
	- Pick out the interesting data points and correlations

## Fusing the data
- Collect the data
	- Logs and sensors,
	- Network information
	- Internet events
	- Intrusion detection
- Add external sources
	- Threat feeds
	- Governmental alerts
	- Advisories and bulletins
	- Social media
- Correlate with big data analytics
	- Focuses on predictive analytics and user behavior analytics
	- Mathematical analysis of unstructured data

## Cybersecurity maneuvers
- In the physical world, move troops and tanks
	- Stop the enemy on the bridge or shore
- In the virtual world, move firewalls and operating systems
	- Set a firewall rule, block an IP address, delete malicious software
- Automated maneuvers
	- Moving at the speed of light
	- The computer reacts instantly
- Combine with fused intelligence
	- Ongoing combat from many fronts
- Tomorrow it's a different fight
