## Evaluating risk
- Risk register
	- Every project has a plan, but also a risk
	- Identify and document the risk associated with each step
	- Apply possible solutions to the identified risks
	- Monitor the results
- Risk Matric / Risk heat Map
	- View the results of the risk assessment
	- Visually identify risk based on color
	- Combines the likelihood of an event with the potential impact
	- Assists with making strategic decisions

## Audit risk model
- Inherent risk
	- Impact + Likelihood
	- Risk that exists in the absence of controls
	- Some models include the existing set of controls
- Residual risk
	- Inherent risk + control effectiveness
	- Risk that exists after controls are considered
	- Some models base it on including additional controls
- Risk appetite
	- The amount of risk an organization is willing to take
## Risk control assessment
- Risk has been determined
	- Heat maps have been created
- Time to build cybersecurity requirements
	- Based on the identified risks
- Find the gap
	- Often requires a formal audit
	- Self-assessments may be an option
- Build and maintain security systems based on the requirements
	- The organizational risk determines the proper controls
- Determine if existing controls are compliant and or non-compliant
	- Make plans to bring everything into compliance
## Risk awareness
- A constantly changing battlefield
		- New risks
		- Emerging risks
	- A nearly overwhelming amount of information
	- Difficult to manage a defense
- Knowledge is key
	- Part of every employee's daily job role
	- Part of the onboarding process for employees and partners
- Maintaining awareness
	- Ongoing group discussions
	- Presentations from law enforcement
	- Attend security conferences and programs
## Regulations that affect risk posture
- Regulations directly associated to cybersecurity
	- Protection of personal information
		- Disclosure of information breaches
	- Requires a minimum level of information security
- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
	- Privacy of patient records
		- New storage requirements
		- Network security
		- Protect against threats
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
	- European Union data protection and privacy
	- Personal data must be protected and managed for privacy
## Qualitative risk assessment
- Identify significant risk factors
	- Ask opinions about the significance
	- Display visually with traffic light grid or similar method

## Quantitative risk assessment
- Likelihood
	- Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
	- How likely is it that a hurricane will hit?
		- Montana = Not likely
		- Florida = Probably likely
- Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
	- What is the monetary loss if a single event occurs?
		- Laptop stolen (Asset Value `[AV]`) = $1,000
- Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
	- ARO `*` SLE
		- Seven laptops a year (ARO) `*` $1,000 (SLE) = $7,000
- The business impact can be more than monetary
	- Quantitative vs. Qualitative
## Disaster types
- Environment threats
	- Tornado
	- Hurricane
	- Earthquake
	- Sever weather
- Person-made threats
	- Human intent
	- Negligence / Error
	- Arson
	- Crime
	- Civil disorder
	- fires
	- riots
	- etc...
- Internal and External
	- Internal threats are from employees
	- External threats are from outside the organization
