## Machine learning
- Our computers are getting smarter
	- They identify patterns in data and improve their predictions
- This requires a lot of training data
	- Face recognition requires analyzing a lot of faces
	- Driving a car requires a lot of road time
- In use every day
	- Stop spam
	- Recommend products from an online retailer
	- What movie would you like to see?
	- Prevent car accidents

## Poisoning the training data
- Confuse the Artificial intelligence
	- Attackers send modified training data that causes the AI to behave incorrectly
- Microsoft AI Chatter Bot named Tay (Thinking About You)
	- Joins Twitter on March23, 2016
	- Designed to learn by interacting with Twitter users
	- Microsoft didn't program in anti-offensive behavior
	- Tay quickly became racist, sexist, and innapropriate

## Evasion attacks
- The AI is only as good as the training
	- Attackers find the holes and limitations
- An AI that knows what spam looks like can be fooled by a different approach
	- Change the number of good and bad words in the message
- An AI that uses real-world information can release confidential information
	- Trained with data that includes social security numbers
	- AI can be fooled into revealing those numbers

## Securing the learning algorithms
- Check the training data
	- Cross check and verify
- Constantly retrain with new data
	- More data
	- Better data
- Train the AI with possible poisoning
	- What would the attacker try to do?
