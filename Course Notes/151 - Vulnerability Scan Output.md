## Identify vulnerability
- The scanner looks for everything
	- We, not "Everything"
		- The signatures are the key
- The vulnerabilities can be cross-referenced online
	- Almost all scanners give you a place to go
	- National Vulnerability Database
		- https://nvd.nist.gov/
	- Microsoft Security Bulletins
		- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/
- Some vulnerabilities cannot be definitively identified
	- You'll have to check manually to see if a system is vulnerable
	- But the scanner gives you a heads-up
## Vulnerability scan results
- Lack of security controls
	- No firewall
	- No anti-virus
	- No anti-spyware
- Misconfigurations
	- Open shares
	- Guest access
- Real vulnerabilities
	- Especially newer ones
	- Occasionally the old ones

## Dealing with false positives
- False positives
	- A vulnerability is identified that doesn't really exist
- This is different than a low-severity vulnerability
	- It's real, but it may not be your highest priority
- False negatives
	- A vulnerability exists, but you didn't detect it
- Update to the latest signatures
	- If you don't know about it, you can't see it
- Work with the vulnerability detection manufacturer
	- They may need to update their signatures for you environment
