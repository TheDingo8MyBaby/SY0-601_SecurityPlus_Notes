## Obfuscation
- The process of making something unclear
	- It's now much more difficult to understand
- But it's not impossible to understand
	- If you know how to read it
- Make source code difficult to read
	- But it doesn't change the functionality of the code
- Hide information inside of an image
	- Steganography
## Steganography
- Greek for "Concealed Writing"
	- Security through obscurity
- Message is invisible
	- But it's really there
- The covertext
	- The container document or file

- Audio steganography
	- Modify the digital audio file
	- Interlace a secret message within the audio
		- Similar technique to image steganography
- Video steganography
	- A sequence of images
	- Use image steganography on a larger scale
	- Manage the signal to noise ration
	- Potentially transfer much more information
