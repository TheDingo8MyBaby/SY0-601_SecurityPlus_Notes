## Security incidents
- User clicks an email attachment and executes malware
	- Malware then communicates with external servers
- DDoS
	- Botnet attack
- Confidential information is stolen
	- Thief wants money or it goes public
- User installs peer-to-peer software and allows external access to internal servers
## Roles and responsibilities
- Incident response team
	- Specialized group
		- Trained and tested
- IT Security management
	- Corporate support
- Compliance officers
	- Intricate knowledge of compliance rules
- Technical staff
	- Your team in the trenches
- User community
	- They see everything

## Preparing for an incident
- Communication methods
	- Phones and contact information
- Incident handling hardware and software
	- Laptops
	- Removable media
	- Forensic software
	- Digital cameras
	- Etc...
- Incident analysis resources
	- Documentation
	- Network diagrams
	- Baselines
	- Critical file hash values
- Incident mitigation software
	- Clean OS
	- Application Images
- Policies needed for incident handling
	- Everyone knows what to do
## The challenge of detection
- Many different detection sources
	- Different levels of detail
	- Different levels of perception
- A large amount of "volume"
	- Attacks are income all the time
	- How do you identify the legitimate threats?
- Incidents are almost always complex
	- Extensive knowledge needed
## Incident precursors
- An incident might occur in the future
	- This is your heads-up
- Web server log
	- Vulnerability scanner in use
- Exploit announcement
	- Monthly Microsoft pat release
		- Adobe flash update
- Direct threats
	- A hacking group doesn't like you
## Incident indicators
- An attack is underway
	- Or an exploit is successful
- Buffer overflow attempt
	- Identified by an intrusion detection / prevention system
- Anti-virus software identifies malware
	- Deletes from OS and notifies administrator
- Host-based monitor detects a configuration change
	- Constantly monitors system files
- Network traffic flows deviate from the norm
	- Requires constant monitoring
## Isolation and containment
- Generally a bad idea to let things run their course
	- An incident can spread quickly
	- It's your fault at that point
- Sandboxes
	- An isolated operating system
	- Run malware and analyze the results
	- Clean out the sandbox when done
- Isolation can sometimes be problematic
	- Malware or infections can monitor connectivity
	- When connectivity is lost, everything could be deleted/encrypted/damaged
## Recovery after an incident
- Get things back to normal
	- Remove the bad, keep the good
- Eradicate the bug
	- Remove malware
	- Disable breached user accounts
	- Fix vulnerabilities
- Recover the system
	- Restore from backups
	- Rebuild from scratch
	- Replace compromised files
	- Tighten down the perimeter
## Reconstitution
- A phased approach
	- It's difficult to fix everything at once
- Recovery may take months
	- Large-scale incidents require a large amount of work
- The plan should be efficient
	- Start with quick, high-value security changes
		- Patches
		- Firewall policy changes
	- Later phases involve much "Heavier lifting"
		- Infrastructure changes
		- Large-scale security rollouts
## Lessons learned
- Learn and improve
	- No system is perfect
- Post-incident meeting
	- Invite everyone affected by the incidient
- Don't wait too long
	- Memories fade over time
	- Some recommendations can be applied to the next event
## Answer the tough questions
- What happened, exatctly?
	- Timestamp of the events
- How did your incident plans work?
	- Did the process operate successfully?
- What would you do differently next time?
	- Retrospective views provide context
- Which indicators would you watch nexxt time?
	- Different precursors may give you better alterts
