- Hardware and software designed for a specific function
	- Or to operate as part of a larger system
- Is built with only this task in mind
	- Can be optimized for size and/or cost
- Common examples
	- Traffic light controllers
	- Digital watches
	- Medical imaging systems
## SoC (System on a Chip)
- Multiple components running on a single chip
	- Common with embedded systems
		- *Raspberry Pi*
- Small form-factor
	- External interface support
	- Cache memory, flash memory
	- Usually lower power consumption
- Security considerations are important
	- Difficult to upgrade hardware
	- Limited off-the-shelf security options
## Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)
- An integrated circuit that can be configured after manufacturing
	- Array of logic blocks
	- Programmed in the field
- A problem doesn't require a hardware replacement
	- Reprogram the FPGA
- Common in infrastructure
	- Firewall logic
	- Routers
## SCADA / ICS
- Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System
	- Large-scale, multi-site Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
- PC manages equipment
	- Power Generation
	- Refining
	- Manufacturing equipment
		- Facilities
		- Industrial
		- Energy
		- Logistics
- Distributed control systems
	- Real-time information
	- System control
- Requires extensive segmentation
	- No access from the outside
## Smart devices / IoT (Internet of Things)
- Sensors
	- Heating/Cooling
	- Lighting
- Smart devices
	- Home automation
	- Video doorbells
- Wearable technology
	- Watches
	- Health monitors
- Facility automation
	- Temperature
	- Air quality
	- Lighting
- Weak defaults
	- IoT Manufacturers are not security professionals
## Specialized
- Medical devices
	- Heart monitors
	- Insulin Pumps
	- Often use older operating systems
- Vehicles
	- Internal network is often accessible from mobile networks
	- Control internal electronics
- Aircraft
	- DoS could damage the aircraft
	- An outage would be problematic
- Smart meters
	- Measure power and water usage
## VoIP
- Voice over Internet Protocol
	- Instead of analog phone line or the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS)
- A relatively complex embedded system
	- Can be relatively important
- Each device is a computer
	- Separate boot process
	- Individual configurations
	- Different capabilities and functionalities
## HVAC
- Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning
	- Thermodynamics
	- Fluid mechanics
	- Heat transfer
- A complex science
	- Not something you can properly design yourself
	- Must be integrated into the fire system
- Pc manages equipment
	- Makes cooling and heating decisions for workspaces and data centers
- Traditionally not built with security in mind
	- Difficult to recover from an infrastructure DoS
## Drones
- Flying vehicle
	- No pilot on board
- May be manually controlled from the ground
	- Often with some autonomy
	- Set it and forget it
- Extensive commercial and non-commercial use
	- May require federal licenses
	- Security and fail-safes are required
## Printers, scanners, and fax machines
- All-in-one or multifunctional devices (MFD)
	- Everything you need in one single device
- No longer a simple printer
	- Very sophisticated firmware
- Some images are stored locally on the device
	- Can be retrieved externally
- Logs are stored on the device
	- Contain communication and fax details
## RTOS (Real-Time Operating System)
- An operating system with a deterministic processing schedule
	- No time to wait for other processes
		- Industrial equipment
		- Automobiles
	- Military Environments
- Extremely sensitive to security issues
	- Non-trivial systems
	- Need to always be available
	- Difficult to know what type of security is in place
## Surveillance systems
- Video/audio surveillance
	- Embedded systems in the cameras and the monitoring stations
- Secure the security system
	- Restrict access from others
	- Prevent a denial of service
- Physically difficult to replace cameras
	- Accessible independently over the network
	- May allow for firmware upgrades
