## Mobile Device Management (MDM)
- Manage company-owned and user-owned mobile devices
	- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)
- Centralize management of the mobile devices
	- Specialized functionality
- Set policies on apps, data, camera, etc...
	- Control the remote device
	- The entire device or a "Partition"
- Manage access control
	- Force screen locks and PINs on these single user devices
## Application management
- Managing mobile apps are a challenge
	- Mobile devices install apps constantly
- Not all applications are secure
	- And some are malicious
	- Android malware is a rapidly growing security concern
- Manage application use through allow lists
	- Only approved applications can be installed
	- Managed through the MDM
- A management challenge
	- New applications must be checked and added
## Content management
- Mobile Content Management (MCM)
	- Secure access to data
	- Protect data from outsiders
- File sharing and viewing
	- On-site content
		- Microsoft Sharepoint
		- File servers
	- Cloud-based storage
		- Office365
		- GoogleDrive
		- DropBox
- Data sent from the mobile device
	- DLP (Data Loss Prevention)
		- Prevents copy/paste of sensitive data
	- Ensure data is encrypted on the mobile device
- Managed from the Mobile Device Manager (MDM)
## Remote wipe
- Remove all data form your mobile device
	- Even if you have no idea where it is
	- Often managed from the MDM
- Connect and wipe from the web
	- Nuke it from anywhere
- Need to plan for this
	- Configure your mobile device now
- Always have a backup
	- Your data can be removed at any time
	- As you are walking out the door
## Geolocation
- Precise tracking details
	- Tracks within feet
- Can be used for good (or bad)
	- Find your phone
	- Find you
- Most phones provide an option to disable
	- Limits functionality of the phones
- May be managed by the MDM
## Geofencing
- Some MDMs allow for geofencing
	- Restrict or allow features when the device is in a particular area
- Cameras
	- The camera might only work when outside the office
- Authentication
	- Only allow logins when the device is located in a particular area
## Screen lock
- All mobile devices can be locked
	- Keep people out of your data
- Simple passcode or strong passcode
	- Numbers vs. Alphanumeric
- Fail too many times?
	- Erase the phone
- Define a lockout policy
	- Create aggressive lockout timers
	- Completely lock the phone
## Push notification services
- Information appears on the mobile device screen
	- The notification is "pushed" to your device
- No user intervention
	- Receive notifications from one app when using a completely different app
- Control of displayed notification can be managed from the MDM
	- Or notifications can be pushed from the MDM
## Passwords and PINs
- The universal help desk call
	- I need to reset my password
- Mobile devices use multiple authentication methods
	- Password/Passphrase
	- PINs
	- Patterns
- Recovery process can be initiated from the MDM
	- Password reset option is provided on the mobile device
		- "What is the name of your favorite car?"
- MDM also has full control
	- Completely remove all security controls
	- Not the default or best practice
## Biometrics
- You are the authentication factor
	- Finprint
	- Face
- May not be the most secure authentication factor
	- Useful in some enviornments
	- Completely forbidden in others
- Availability is managed through the MDM
	- Organization determines the security of the device
- Can be managed per-app
	- Some apps require additional biometric authentication
## Context-aware authentication
- Who needs 2FA?
	- The attackers can get around anything
- Authentication can be contextual
	- If it walks like a duck...
- Combine multiple contexts
	- Where you normally login
		- IP Address
	- Where you normally frequent
		- GPS Information
	- Other devices that may be paired
		- Bluetooth
		- Etc...
	- And many others
- An emerging technology
	- Another way to keep data safe
## Containerization
- Difficult to separate person from business
	- Especially when the device is BYOD
	- Owned by the employee
- Separate enterprise mobile apps and data
	- Create a virtual "container" for company data
	- A contained area
		- limit data sharing
	- Storage segmentation keeps data separate
- Easy to manage offboarding
	- Only the company information is deleted
	- Personal data is retained
	- Keep your:
		- Pictures
		- Video
		- Music
		- Email
		- Etc...
## Full device encryption
- Scramble all of the data on the mobile device
	- Even if you lose it, the contents are safe
- Devices handle this in different ways
	- Strongest
	- Stronger
	- Strong
- Encryption isn't trivial
	- Uses a lot of CPU cycles
	- Complex integration between hardware and software
- Don't lose or forget your password
	- There's no recover
	- Often backed up on the MDM
