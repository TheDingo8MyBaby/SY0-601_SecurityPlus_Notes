## RFID (Radio-frequency identification)
- It's everywhere
	- Access badgest
	- Inventory/Assembly line tracking
	- Pet/Animal identification
	- Anything that needs to be tracked
- Radar technology
	- Radio energy transmitted to the tag
	- RF powers the tag, ID is transmitted back
	- Bidirectional communication
	- Some tag formats can be active/powered

## RFID attacks
- Data capture
	- View communication
	- Replay attack
- Spoof the reader
	- Write your own data to the tag
- Denial of service
	- Signal jamming
- Decrypt communication
	- Many default keys are on Google

## Near field communication (NFC)
- Two-way wireless communication
	- Builds on RFID, which is mostly one-way
- Payment systems
	- Many options available
- Bootstrap for other wireless
	- NFC helps with Bluetooth paring
- Access token, identity "card"
	- Short range with encryption support

## NFC security concerns
- Remote capture
	- It's a wireless network
	- 10 meters for active devices
- Frequency jamming
	- Denial of service
- Relay / Replay attack
	- On-path attack
- Loss of RFC device control
	- Stolen/lost phone
