## Biometric Factors
- Fingerprint scanner
	- Phones
	- Laptops
	- Door access
- Retinal scanner
	- Unique capillary structure in the back of the eye
- Iris scanner
	- Texture
	- Color
- Voice recognition
	- Talk for access
- Facial recognition
	- Shape of the face and features
- Gait analysis
	- Identify a person based on how they walk
		- Many unique measurements
- Veins
	- Vascular scanners
		- Match the blood vessels visible from the surface of the skin

## Biometric acceptance rates
- False acceptance rate (FAR)
	- Likelihood that un unauthorized user will be accepted
	- Not sensitive enough
- False rejection rate (FRR)
	- Likelihood that an authorized user will be rejected
	- Too sensitive
- Crossover error rate (CER)
	- Defines the overall accuracy of the biometric system
	- The rate at which FAR and FRR are equal
	- Adjust sensitivity to equalize both values
