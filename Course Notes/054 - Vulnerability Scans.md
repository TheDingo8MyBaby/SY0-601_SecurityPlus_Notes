## Vulnerability scanning
- Usually minimally invasive
	- Unlike a penetration test
- Port scan
	- Poke around and see what's open
- Identify systems
	- And security devices
- Test from the outside and inside
	- Don't dismiss insider threats
- Gather as much information as possible
	- We'll separate wheat form chaff later

## Scan types
- Scanners are very powerful
	- Use many different techniques to identify vulnerabilities
- Non-intrusive scans
	- Gather information, don't try to exploit a vulnerability
- Intrusive scans
	- You'll try out the vulnerability to see if it works
- Non-credentialed scans
	- The scanner can't login to the remote device
- Credentialed scan
	- You're a normal user, emulates an insider attack

## Identify vulnerabilities
- The scanner looks for everything
	- Well, not everything
		- The signatures are the key
- Application scans
	- Desktop
	- Mobile
	- Etc...
- Web application scans
	- Software on a web server
- Network scans
	- Misconfigured firewalls
	- Open ports
	- Vulnerable devices

## Vulnerability research
- The vulnerabilities can be cross-referenced online
	- Almost all scanners give you a place to go
- National Vulnerability Database:
	- http://nvd.nist.gov/
		- Synchronized with the CVE list
		- Enhanced search functionality
- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE):
	- https://cve.mitre.org/cve/
- Microsoft Security Bulletins:
	- http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/current.aspx
- Some vulnerabilities cannot be definitively identified
	- You'll have to check manually to see if a system is vulnerable
	- The scanner gives you a heads-up
- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
	- Quantitative scoring of a vulnerability:
		- 0 to 10
	- The scoring standards change over time
	- Different scoring for CVSS 2.0 vs 3.x
- Industry collaboration
	- Enhanced feed sharing and automation

## Vulnerability scan log review
- Lack of security controls
	- No firewall
	- No anti-virus
	- No anti-spyware
- Misconfigurations
	- Open shares
	- Guest access
- Real vulnerabilities
	- Especially newer ones
	- Occasionally the old ones

## Dealing with false positives
- False positives
	- A vulnerability is identified that doesn't really exist
- This is different than a low-severity vulnerability
	- It's real, but it may not be your highest priority
- False negatives
	- A vulnerability exists, but you didn't detect it
- Update to the latest signatures
	- If you don't know about it, you can't see it
- Work with the vulnerability detection manufacturer
	- They may need to update their signatures for your environment

## Configuration review
- Validate the security of device configurations
	- It's easy to misconfigure one thing
	- A single unlocked windows puts the entire home at risk
- Workstations
	- Account configurations, local device settings
- Servers
	- Access controls, permission settings
- Security devices
	- Firewall rules
	- Authentication options
