## Point-to-point
- One-to-one connection
	- Conversation between two devices
- Connections between buildings
	- Point-to-point network links
- Wi-Fi repeaters
	- Extend the length of an existing network
## Point-to-multipoint
- One of the most popular communication methods today
	- 802.11 wireless
- Does not imply full connectivity between nodes
## Cellular networks
- Mobile devices
	- "Cell" Phones
- Separate land into "Cells"
	- Antenna covers a cell with certain frequencies
- Security concerns
	- Traffic monitoring
	- Location tracking
	- Worldwide access to a mobile device
## Wi-Fi
- Local network access
	- Local security problems
- Same security concerns as other Wi-F devices
- Data capture
	- Encrypt your data
- On-path attack
	- Modify and/or monitor data
- Denial of service
	- Frequency interference
## Bluetooth
- High speed communication over short distances
	- PAN (Personal Area Network)
- Connects our mobile devices
	- Smartphones
	- Tethering
	- Headsets and Headphones
	- Health monitors
	- Automobile and phone integration
	- Smartwatches
	- External speakers
## RFID (Radio-frequency Identification)
- It's everywhere
	- Access badges
	- Inventory/Assembly line tracking
	- Pet/Animal identification
	- Anything that needs to be tracked
- Radar technology
	- Radio energy transmitted to the tag
	- RF powers the tag
		- ID is transmitted back
	- Bidirectional communication
		- Some tag formats can be active/powered
## Near field communication (NFC)
- Two-way wireless communication
	- Builds on RFID
- Payment systems
	- Google Wallet
	- Apple Pay
- Bootstrap for other wireless devices
	- NFC helps with Bluetooth pairing
- Access token / Identity "Card"
	- Short range with encryption support
## NFC Security concerns
- Remote capture
	- It's a wireless network
	- 10 meters for active devices
- Frequency jamming
	- Denial of service
- Replay / Replay attack
	- Man in the middle
- Loss of RFC device control
	- Stolen / Lost phone
## IR (Infrared)
- Included on many smartphones, tables, and smartwatches
	- Not really used much
- Control your entertainment center
	- Almost exclusively IR
- File transfers are possible
- Other phones can be used to control your IR devices
## USB (Universal Serial Bus)
- Physical connectivity to your mobile device
	- USB to your computer
		- USB
		- Lightning
		- Other proprietary connections
- Physical access is always a concern
	- May be easier to gain access than over a remote connection
- A locked device is relatively secure
	- Always auto-lock
- Mobile phones can also exfiltrate
	- Phone can appear to be a USB storage device
## Global Positioning System (GPS)
- Created by the U.S. Department of Defense
	- Over 30 satellite currently in orbit
- Precise navigation
	- Need to see at least 4 satellites
- Determines location based on timing differences
	- Longitude
	- Latitude
	- Altitude
- Mobile device location services and geotracking
	- Maps
	- Directions
- Determine physical location based on GPS
		- WiFi
		- Cellular towers
