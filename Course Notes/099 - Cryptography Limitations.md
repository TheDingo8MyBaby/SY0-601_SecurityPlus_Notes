## Finding balance
- Cryptography isn't a perfect solution
	- It can have significant limitations
- Not all implementations are the same
	- Different platforms
	- Different cryptographic options
- Cryptography can't fix bad technique
	- Hashing easily guessed passwords without a salt
- Every situation is different
	- Do your homework
## Limitation
- Speed
	- Cryptography adds overhead
	- A system needs CPU
		- CPU Needs power
	- More involved encryption increases the load
- Size
	- Typical block ciphers don't increase the size of encrypted data
	- AES block size is 128 bits/16 bytes
	- Encrypting 8 bytes would potentially double the storage size
- Weak keys
	- Larger keys are generally more difficult to brute force
	- The weak IV in RC4 resulted in the WEP security issues
- Time
	- Encryption and hashing takes time
	- Larger files take longer
	- Asymmetric is slower than symmetric
## Limitations
- Longevity
	- A specific cryptographic technology can become less secure over time
	- Smaller keys are easier to brute force
		- Larger keys take longer to process
	- Key retirement is a good best practice
- Predictability and entropy
	- Random numbers are critical for secure cryptography
	- Hardware random number generators can be predictable
	- A passphrase needs to be appropriately random
- Key reuse
	- Reusing the same key reduces complexity
		- Less cost and effort to recertify keys
		- Less administrative overhead
	- If the key is compromised, everything using that key is at risk
	- IoT devices often have keys embedded in the firmware
- Resource vs. security constraints
	- IoT devices have limited CPU, memory and power
	- Real-time applications can't delay
	- Difficult to maintain and update security components
