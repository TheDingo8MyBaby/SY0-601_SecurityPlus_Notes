## Cloud access security broker (CASB)
- Clients are at work, data is in the cloud
	- How do you keep everything secure?
	- The organization is already has well-defined security policies
- How do you make your security policies work in the cloud?
	- Integrate a CASB
	- Implemented as;
		- Client software
		- Local security appliances
		- Cloud-based security solutions
- Visibility
	- Determine what apps are in use
	- Are they authorized to use the apps?
- Compliance
	- Are users complying with HIPAA? PCI?
- Threat prevention
	- Allow access by authorized users, prevent attacks
- Data security
	- Ensure that all data transfers are encrypted
	- Protect the transfer of PII with DLP
## Application security
- Secure cloud-based applications
	- Complexity increases in the cloud
- Application misconfigurations
	- One of the most common security issues
	- Especially cloud storage
- Authorization and access
	- Controls should be strong enough for access from anywhere
- API Security 
	- Attackers will try to exploits interfaces and APIs
## Next-Gen Secure Web Gateway
- Protect users and devices
	- Regardless of location and activity
- Go beyond URLs and GET requests
	- Examine the application API
	- Dropbox for personal use or corporate use?
- Examine JSON strings and API requests
	- Allow or disallow certain activities
- Instance-aware security
	- A development instance is different than a production instance
## Firewalls in the cloud
- Control traffic flows in the cloud
	- Inside the cloud and external flows
- Cost
	- Relatively inexpensive compare to appliances
	- Virtual firewalls
	- host-base firewalls
- Segmentation
	- Between Microservices, VMs, or VPCs
- OSI layers
	- Layer 4
		- TCP/UDP
	- Layer 7
		- Application
## Security controls
- Cloud-native security controls
	- Integrated and supported by the cloud provider
	- Many configuration options
	- Security is part of the infrastructure
	- No additional costs
- Third-Party solutions
	- Support across multiple cloud providers
	- Single pane of glass
	- Extend policies outside the scope of the  cloud provider
	- More extensive reporting
