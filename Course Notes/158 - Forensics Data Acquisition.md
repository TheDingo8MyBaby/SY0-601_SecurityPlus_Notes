## Order of volatility
- How long does data stick around?
	- Some media is much more volatile than others
	- Gather data in order from the most volatile to less volatile

## Disk
- Copy everything on a storage drive
	- Hard Drive
	- SSD
	- Flash Drive
- Drive image perparation
	- Power down to prevent changes
	- Remove storage drive
- Connect to imaging device
	- With write-protection
- Forensic clone
	- Bit-for-bit copy
	- Preserve all data
		- Event the "Deleted" data
## Random-acces Memory (RAM)
- A difficult target to capture
	- Changes constantly
	- Capturing data changes the data
- Memory dump
	- Grab everything in active RAM
	- Many third-party tools
- Important data
	- Browsing history
	- Clipboard information
	- Encryption keys
	- Command history
## Swap/pagefile
- used by different operating systems
	- Slightly different usage in each
- A place to store RAM when memory is depleted
	- There's a lot more space on the storage drive
		- Transfer pages of RAM to a storage drive
- Can also contain portions of an application
	- Page out portions that aren't in use
- Contains data similar to a RAM dump
	- Anything active on the system
## Operating system
- OS Files and data
	- May have been modified
- Core operating system
	- Executable files and libraries
	- Can be compared later to known-good files
	- Usually captured with a drive image
- Other OS data
	- Logged in users
	- Open ports
	- Processes currently running
	- Attached device list
## Device
- Mobile devices and tablets
	- A more challenging forensics task
- Capture data
	- use an existing backup file
	- Transfer image of USB
- Data
	- Phone calls
	- Contact information
	- Text message
	- Email data
	- Images
	- Movies
## Firmware
- Extract the device firmware
	- Rootkits and exploited hardware device
	- A reprogrammed firmware or ROM
- Specific to the platform
	- Firmware implementations vary widely
- Attack gains access to the device
	- Maintains access through OS updates
- Data discovery
	- Exploit data
	- Firmware functionality
	- Real-time data
## Snapshot
- Generally associated with virtual machines (VMs)
	- A point-in-time system image
- Incremental between snapshots
	- Original image is the full backup
	- Each snapshot is incremented from the last
	- Restoring requires the original and all snapshots
- Contains all files and information about a VM
	- Similar to a system image
		- Operating system
		- Applications
		- User data
		- Etc...
## Cache
- Store data for use later
	- Often used to increase performance
	- Many different caches
		- CPU
		- Disk
		- Internet/Browser
		- Etc...
- Can contain specialized data
	- CPU cache is very short-term instruction storage
- Some data may never be used
	- Erased after a specified timeframe or when the cache is full
	- Browser caches are often long-lived
- Data
	- URL locations
	- Browser page components
		- Text
		- Images
## Network
- Gather information about and from the network
	- Network connections
	- Packet captures
- Inbound and outbound sessions
	- OS and application traffic
- Packet data
	- Capture raw network data
	- May include long-term packet captures
- Third-party packet captures
	- Firewalls
	- IPS
	- Etc...
## Artifacts
- Digital items left behind
	- Every contact leave a trace
	- May not be obvious to access
- Artifact locations
	- Log information
	- Flash memory
	- Prefetch cache files
	- Recycle Bin
	- Browser bookmarks and logins
