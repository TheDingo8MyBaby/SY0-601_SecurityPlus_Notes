## Rogue access points
- An unauthorized wireless access point
	- May be added by an employee or an attacker
	- Not necessarily malicious
	- A significant potential backdoor
- Very easy to plug in a wireless AP (Access Point)
	- Or enable wireless sharing in your OS
- Schedule a periodic survey
	- Walk around your building/campus
		- Use third-party tools / WiFi Pineapple
- Consider using 802.1X (Network Access Control)
	- You must authenticate, regardless of the connection type

## Wireless evil twins
- Looks legitimate, but actually malicous
	- The wireless version of phising
- Configure an access point to look like an existing network
	- Same )or similar) SSID and security settings/captive portal
- Overpower the existing access points
	- May not require the same physical location
- WiFi hotspots (and users) are easy to fool
	- And they're wide open
- You encrypt your communication, right?
	- Use HTTPS **and** a VPN
