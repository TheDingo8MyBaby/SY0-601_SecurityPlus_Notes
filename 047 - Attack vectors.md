- A method used by the attacker
	- Gain access or infect to the target
- A lot of work goes into finding vulnerabilities in these vectors
	- Some are more vulnerable than others
- IT security professional spend their career watching these vectors
	- Closing up existing vectors
	- Finding new ones

## Direct access attack vectors
- There's a reason we lock the data center
	- Physical access to a system is a significant attack vector
- Modify the operating system
	- Reset the administrator password in a few minutes
- Attach a keylogger
	- Collect usernames and passwords
- Transfer files
	- Take it with you
		- Connect a flashdrive / harddrive and transfer
- Denial of service
	- This power cable is in the way

## Wireless attack vectors
- Default login credentials
	- Modify the access point configuration
- Rogue access point
	- A less-secure entry point to the network
- Evil twin
	- Attacker collects authentication details
	- Man-in-the-middle attacks
		- On-path attacks
- Protocol vulnerabilities
	- 2017: WPA2 Key Reinstallation Attack (KRAK)
	- Older encryption protocols (WEP, WPA)

## Email attack vectors
- One of the biggest (and most successful) attack vectors
	- Everyone has email
- Phishing attacks
	- People want to click links
- Deliver the malware to the user
	- Attach it to the message
- Social engineering attacks
	- Invoice scam

## Supply chain attack vectors
- Tamper with the underlying infrastructure
	- Or manufacturing process
- Gain access to a network using a vendor
	- 2013 Target credit card breach
- Malware can modify the manufacturing process
	- 2010:  Stuxnet disrupts Iran's uranium enrichment program
- Counterfeit networking equipment
	- Install backdoors, substandard performance and availability
	- 2020:  Fake Cisco Catalyst 2960-X and WS-2960X-48TS-L
		- Did not originate from Cisco.

## Social media attack vectors
- Attackers thank you for putting your personal information online
	- Where you are and when
	- Vacation pictures are especially telling
- User profiling
	- Where were you born?
	- What is the name of your school mascot?
- Fake friends are fake
	- The inner circle can provide additional information

## Removable media attack vectors
- Get around the firewall
	- The USB interface
- Malicious software on USB flash drives
	- Infect air gapped networks
	- Industrial systems, high-security services
- USB devices can act as keyboards
	- Hacker on a chip
		- Think: BadUSB / RubberDucky
- Data exfiltration
	- Terabytes of data walk out the door
		- Zero bandwidth used

## Cloud attack vectors
- Publicly-facing applications and services
	- Mistakes are made all the time
- Security misconfigurations
	- Data permissions and public data stores
- Brute force attacks
	- Or phish the users of the cloud service
- Orchestration attacks
	- Make the cloud build new application instances
		- It can cost resources and money, even if nothing is exfiltrated
- Denial of service
	- Disable the cloud services for everyone
