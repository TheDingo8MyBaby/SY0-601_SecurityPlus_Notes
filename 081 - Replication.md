## SAN replication
- Share data between different devices
	- If one device fails, you can still work with the data
	- VERY fast recovery times compared to traditional backups
- Storage area networks (SANs)
	- Specialized high-performance network of storage devices
- SAN-to-SAN replication
	- Duplicate date from one data center to another
- SAN snapshot
	- Create a state of data based on a point in time
	- Copy that state to other SANs

## VM replication
- Virtual machine redundancy
	- Maintain one VM
		- Replicate to all others
	- The virtual machine is really just one big file
- Consistent service offering
	- Maintain copies anywhere in the world
- Recover from a replicated copy
	- Provides a backup if needed
- Efficient copying
	- Only replicates the data that has changed

## On premises vs. cloud redundancy
- Speed
	- Local devices are connected over very fast networks
	- Cloud connections are almost always slower
- Money
	- Purchasing your own storage is expensive capital investment
	- Cloud costs have a low entry point and can scale
- Security
	- Local data is private
	- Data stored in the cloud requires additional security controls
