## Password keys
- Hardware-based authentication
	- Something you have
- Helps prevent unauthorized logins and account takeovers
	- The key must be present to login
- Doesn't replace other factors
	- Passwords are still important
## Password vaults
- Password managers
	- All passwords in one location
	- A database of credentials
- Secure storage
	- All credentials are encrypted
	- Cloud-based synchronization options
- Create unique passwords
	- Passwords are not the same across sites
- Personal and enterprise options
	- Corporate access
## Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
- A specification for cryptographic functions
	- Hardware to help with all of this encryption stuff
- Cryptographic processor
	- Random Number Generator
	- Key generators
- Persistent memory
	- Comes with unique keys burned in during production
- Versatile memory
	- Storage keys
	- Hardware configuration information
- Password protected
	- No dictionary attacks
## Hardware Security Module (HSM)
- High-end cryptographic hardware
	- Plug-in card or separate hardware device
- Key backup
	- Secured storage
- Cryptographic accelerators
	- Offload that CPU overhead from other devices
- Used in large environments
	- Clusters
	- Redundant power
## Knowledge-based authentication (KBA)
- Use personal knowledge as an authentication factor
	- Something you know
- Static KBA
	- Pre-configured shared secrets
	- Often used with account recover
	- What was the make and model of your first car?
- Dynamic KBA
	- Questions are based on an identity verification service
		- What was your street number when you lived in Pembroke Pines, Florida
