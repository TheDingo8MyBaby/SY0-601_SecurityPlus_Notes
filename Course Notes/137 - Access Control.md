- Authorization
	- The process of ensuring only authorized rights are exercised
		- Policy enforcement
	- The process of determining rights
		- Policy definition
- Users receive rights based on Access Control models
	- Different business needs or mission requirements
## Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
- The operating system limits the operation on an object
	- Based on security clearance levels
- Every object gets a label
	- Confidential
	- Secret
	- Top Secret
	- Etc...
- Labeling of objects uses predefined rules
	- The administrator decides who gets access to what security level
	- Users cannot change these settings
## Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
- Used in most operating systems
	- A familiar access control model
- You create a spreadsheet
	- As the owner, you control who has access
		- You can modify access at any time
- Very flexible access control
	- And very weak security
## Role-based access control (RBAC)
- You have a role in your organization
	- Manager
	- Director
	- Team lead
	- Project manager
- Administrators provide access based on the role of the user
	- Rights are gained implicitly instead of explicitly
- In Windows, use Groups to provide role-based access control
	- You are in shipping and receiving, so you can use the shipping software
	- You are the manager, so you can review shipping logs
## Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Users can have complex relationships to applications and data
	- Access may be based on many different criteria
- ABAC can consider many parameters
	- A "Next generation" authorization model
	- Aware of context
- Combine and evaluate multiple parameters
	- Resource information
	- IP address
	- Time of day
	- Desired action
	- Relationship to the data
	- Etc...
## Rule-based access control
- Generic term for following rules
	- Conditions other than who you are
- Access is determined through system-enforce rules
	- System administrators, not users
- The rule is associate with the object
	- System checks the ACLs for that object
- Rule examples;
	- "Lab network access is only available between 9AM and 5PM"
	- "Only Chrome browsers may complete this web form"
## File system security
- Store files and access them
		- Hard drive
		- SSDs
		- Flash Drives
		- DVDs
	- Part of most operating systems
- Accessing information
	- Access control list
	- Group/User rights and permissions
	- Can be centrally administered and/or users can manage files they own
- Encryption can be built-in
	- The file system handles encryption and decryption
## Conditional access
- Difficult to apply old methods of authentication to new methods of working
	- Mobile workforce
	- Manny different devices
	- Constantly changing cloud
- Conditions
	- Employee or Partner
	- Location
	- Type of application accessed
	- Device
	- Etc...
- Controls
	- Allow or Block
	- Require MFA
	- Provide limited access
	- Require password reset
	- Etc...
- Administrators can build complex access rules
	- Complete control over data access
## Privileged access management (PAM)
- Managing superuser access
	- Administrator and Root
	- You don't want this in the wrong hands
- Store privileged accounts in a digital vault
	- Access is only granted from the vault by request
	- These privileges are temporary
- PAM advantages
	- Centralized password management
	- Enables automation
	- Manage access for each user
	- Extensive tracking and auditing
