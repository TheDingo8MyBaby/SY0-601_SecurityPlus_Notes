- Physically secure the data
	- As important as the digital security
- An important part of the security policy
	- Not a question to leave unanswered
- Secure active operations
	- Prevent physical access to the systems
- Secure offline data
	- Backups are an important security concern
## Air gap
- Physical separation between networks
	- Secure network and insecure network
	- Separate customer infrastructures
- Most environments are shared
		- Routers
		- Switches
		- Firewalls
	- Some of these are virtualized
- Specialized networks require air gaps
	- Stock market networks
	- Power systems/SCADA
	- Airplanes
	- Nuclear power plant operations
## Vaults and safes
- Vault
	- A secure reinforced room
	- Store backup media
	- Protect from disaster or theft
	- Often onsite
- Safe
	- Similar to a vault, but smaller
	- Less expensive to implements
	- Space is limited
	- Install ate more locations
## Hot and cold aisles
- Data centers
	- Lots and lots of equipment
	- This equipment generates heat
- Optimize cooling
	- Keep components at optimal temperatures
- Conserve energy
	- Data centers are usually very large rooms
	- Focus the cooling
	- Lower energy costs
