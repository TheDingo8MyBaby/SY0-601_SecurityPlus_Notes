## Embedded Systems
- Not usually a fully capable computer
	- Low Cost
	- Purpose-built
- Adds additional constraints
	- May have limited or missing features
	- Upgradability limitations
	- Limits in communication options
- An ongoing trade off
	- Lose cost systems
	- Unique managements challenges
## Constraints
- Power
	- May not have access to a main power source
	- Batteries may need to be replaced and maintained
- Compute
	- Low-power CPUs are limited in speed
	- Cost and heat considerations
- Network
	- May not have the option for a wired link
	- May be in the middle of a field
	- Wireless is the limiting factor
- Crypto
	- Limited hardware options
	- Difficult to change or modify cryptography features
- Inability to patch
	- Some IoT devices have no field-upgradable options
	- Upgrade options may be limited or difficult to install
- Authentication
	- Security features are often an afterthought
	- Limited Options:
		- No multi-factor
		- Limited integration with existing directory services
- Range
	- Purpose-built
		- Usually does one thing very well
	- May not provide much additional functionality
- Cost
	- Single-purpose functionality comes at a low cost
	- Low cost may affect product quality
- Implied trust
	- Limited access to the hardware and software
	- Difficult to verify the security posture
