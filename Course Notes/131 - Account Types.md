## User accounts
- An account on a computer associated with a specific person
	- The computer associates the user with a specific identification number
- Storage and files can be private to that user
	- Even if another person is using the same computer
- No privileged access to the operating system
	- Specifically not allowed on a user account
- This is the account type most people will use
	- Your user community
## Shared and generic accounts
- Shared account
	- Used by more than one person
		- Guest Login
		- Anonymous Login
- Very difficult to create an audit trail
	- No way to know exactly who was working
	- Difficult to determine the proper privileges
- Password management becomes difficult
	- Password changes require notifying everyone
	- Difficult to remember so many password changes
		- *Just write it down on this yellow sticky paper*
- Best practice:
	- Don't use these accounts
## Guest accounts
- Access to a computer for guests
	- No access to change settings

## Service accounts
- Used exclusively by services running on a computer
	- No interactive / user access (Ideally)
		- Web Server
