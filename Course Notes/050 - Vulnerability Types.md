##  Zero-day attacks
- Many applications have vulnerabilities
	- We've just not found them yet
- Someone is working hard to find the next big vulnerability
	- The good guys share these with developers
- Attackers keep these yet-to-be discovered holes  to themselves
	- They want to use these vulnerabilities for personal gain
- Zero-day
	- The vulnerability has not been detected or published
	- Zero-day exploits are increasingly common
- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
	- http://cve.mitre.org/

## Open permissions
- Very easy to leave a door open
	- The hackers w ill always find it
- Increasingly common with cloud storage
	- Statistical chance of finding an open permission
- June 2017:  14 million Verizon records exposed
	- Third-party left an Amazon S3 data repository open
	- Researcher found the data before anyone else
- Many, many other examples
	- Secure your permissions!

## Unsecured root accounts
- The Linux root account
	- The Administrator or superuser account
- Can be a misconfiguration
	- Intentionally configuring an easy-to-hack password
		- 123456
		- ninja
		- football
		- etc...
- Disable direct login to the root account
	- Use the su or sudo option
- Protect accounts with root or administrator access
	- There should not be a lot of these

## Errors
- Error messages can provide useful information to an attacker
	- Service type
	- Version information
	- Debug data
- September 2015:  Patreaon is compromised
	- Used a debugger to help monitor and troubleshoot web site issues
	- Was left exposed to the internet
	- Effectively allowed for remote code executions
	- Gigabytes of customer data was released online

## Weak encryption
- Encryption protocol (AES, 3DES, Etc...)
	- Length of the encryption key (40 bits, 128 bits, 256 bits, etc...)
	- Hash used for the integrity check (SHA, MD5, etc)
	- Wireless encryption (WEP, WPA)
- Some cipher suites are easier to break than others
	- Say updated with the latest best practices
- TLS is one of the most common issues
	- Over 300 cipher suites
- Which are good and which are bad?
	- Weak or null encryption (less than 128 bit key sizes), outdated hashes (MD5)

## Insecure protocols
- Some protocols aren't encrypted
	- All traffic sent in the clear
		- Telnet
		- FTP
		- SMTP
		- IMAP
- Verify with a packet capture
	- View everything sent over the network
- Use the encrypted versions
	- SSH
	- SFTP
	- IMAPS
	- Etc...

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020240120020750.png)## Default settings
- Every application and network device has a default login
	- Not all of these are ever changed
- Mirai botnet
	- Takes advantage of default configurations
	- Takes over Internet of Things (IoT) devices
	- 60+ default configurations
	- Cameras, routers, doorbells, garage door openers, etc.
- Mirai release as open-source software
	- There's a lot more where that came from

## Open ports and services
- Services will open ports
	- It's important to manage access
- Often managed with a firewall
	- Manage traffic flows
	- Allow or deny based on port number or application
- Firewall rulesets can be complex
	- It's easy to make a mistake
- Always test and audit
	- Double and triple check

## Improper patch management
- Often centrall managed
	- The update server determine when you patch
	- Test all of your apps, then deploy
	- Efficiently manage bandwidth
- Firmware
	- The BIOS of the device
- Operating system
	- Monthly and on-demand patches
- Applications
	- Provided by the manufacturer as-needed

## Improper patch management
- May through July 2017:  Equifax
	- Data breach of:
		- 147.9 million Americans
		- 15.2 million British citizens
		- 19,000 Canadian citizens
	- Names
	- SSNs
	- Birthdates
	- Addresses
	- some driver's license numbers
- Apache Struts vulnerability from March 7th, 2017
	- Breach started March 12th
	- Wasn't patched by Equifax until July 30th
		- After discovering "Suspicious network traffic"
	- September 7th:  Public disclosure
- September 15th:  CIO and CSO depart Equifax
- July 2019:  Equifax pays $575 million in fines

## Legacy platforms
- Some devices remain install for a long time
	- Perhaps too long
- Legacy devices
	- Older operating systems, applications, middleware
- May be running end-of-life software
	- The risk needs to be compared to the return
- May require additional security protections
	- Additional firewall rules
	- IPS signature rules for older operating systems
